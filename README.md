# The Wax Museum — Simple static site

This workspace contains a small multi-page static website with these pages:

- `index.html` — Home (landing page)
- `travelling.html` — Travelling exhibitions
- `waxstories.html` — Wax stories
- `collection.html` — Museum collection
- `links.html` — Interesting links
- `styles.css` — Shared styles and responsive navigation

To view locally, open `index.html` in your browser. For a local HTTP server (recommended), run one of these commands from the project directory:

PowerShell (if Python 3 is installed):
```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

If you want changes or a site generator (Jekyll, Eleventy, etc.), tell me and I can scaffold that next.

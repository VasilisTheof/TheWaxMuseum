Place the image file provided in the attachments here and name it exactly:

  images/what-is-wax.png

Notes about transparency:
- If your image has transparent areas (PNG with alpha), the page background will now show through. The site uses a light "parchment" background so the torn-paper edges look natural.
- If you want a different page background or a solid background behind the image, update `styles.css` or tell me what you'd like.

If you want me to add the attached image file into the repo, confirm and I'll save it as `images/what-is-wax.png` for you.
